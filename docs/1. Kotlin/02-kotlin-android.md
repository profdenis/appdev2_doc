# Kotlin for Android

[Source](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/android-overview.html)

Android mobile development has been [Kotlin-first](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first) since Google I/O in 2019.

More than 50% of professional Android developers use Kotlin as their primary language, while only 30% use Java as their
main language. 70% of developers whose primary language is Kotlin say that Kotlin makes them more productive.

By using Kotlin for Android development, you can benefit from:

* **Less code combined with greater readability**. Spend less time writing your code and trying to understand others'
  code.
* **Fewer common errors**. Applications built with Kotlin are 20% less likely to crash based
  on [Google's internal data](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/fewer-crashes-and-more-stability-with-kotlin-b606c6a6ac04).
* **Kotlin support in Jetpack libraries**. [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Android's
  recommended modern toolkit for building native UI in
  Kotlin. [KTX extensions](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) add Kotlin language features like coroutines,
  extension functions, lambdas, and named parameters to existing Android libraries.
* **Support for multiplatform development**. Kotlin Multiplatform enables development not only for Android but also
  for [iOS](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/multiplatform/), backend, and web
  applications. [Some Jetpack libraries](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/multiplatform) are already
  multiplatform. [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/), JetBrains' declarative UI
  framework based on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, makes it possible to share user interfaces across platforms - iOS,
  Android, desktop, and web.
* **Mature language and environment**. Since its creation in 2011, Kotlin has continuously evolved, not only as a
  language but as an entire ecosystem with robust tooling. Today, it is seamlessly integrated
  into [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and is actively used by many companies to develop Android
  applications.
* **Interoperability with Java**. You can use Kotlin in combination with the Java programming language in your
  applications without having to migrate all your code to Kotlin.
* **Easy to learn**. Kotlin is very easy to learn, especially for Java developers.
* **Large community**. Kotlin enjoys strong support and many contributions from the worldwide community. More than 95%
  of the top thousand Android applications use Kotlin.

Many startups and Fortune 500 companies have already developed Android applications using Kotlin, see the list
on [Google's Android Developers website](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/stories).

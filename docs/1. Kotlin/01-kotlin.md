# The Kotlin Programming Language

Kotlin is a modern statically typed programming language used by more than 60% of professional Android developers, which
helps improve productivity, developer satisfaction, and code
safety. [https://developer.android.com/kotlin?hl=fr](https://developer.android.com/kotlin?hl=fr)

Since Google I/O 2019, Google has declared Android mobile development
as [Kotlin-first](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first?hl=fr). This means that Google recommends
Android developers use Kotlin as their first choice programming language for developing new Android applications. Kotlin
offers many advantages for Android development, including null safety, code clarity and conciseness, and complete
interoperability with Java, which was previously the recommended language for Android development.
